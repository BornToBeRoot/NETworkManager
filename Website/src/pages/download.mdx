  <div>
    <p>NETworkManager is available in three different versions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Setup</b> (MSI-Installer): Recommended for most users, installs
        NETworkManager for all users on the system. Requires administrator
        privileges. Settings and profiles are stored in the user profile
        directory under <code>~\Documents\NETworkManager</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Portable</b> (ZIP-Archive): Run NETworkManager without installation,
        e.g. from a USB stick or network share. Settings and profiles are stored
        in the same directory as the executable. Upgrades are supported by
        copying the <code>Profiles</code> and <code>Settings</code> directories
        to the new version.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Archive</b> (ZIP-Archive): Similar to Portable, but stores profiles
        and settings in the user profile directory under{" "}
        <code>~\Documents\NETworkManager</code>. This version might be useful
        for custom deployment scenarios (e.g. Terminal Server, Intune, etc.).
      </li>
    </ul>
