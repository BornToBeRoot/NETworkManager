## Which version should I download?

NETworkManager is available in three different versions:

| Version | Description |
|---|---|
| **Setup** (MSI Installer) | Recommended for most users. Installs system-wide and requires administrator privileges. Settings and profiles are stored in `~\Documents\NETworkManager`. Suitable for centralized deployment via Intune, SCCM, etc. |
| **Portable** (ZIP Archive) | Run without installation — ideal for a USB stick or network share. Settings and profiles are stored next to the executable. To upgrade, copy the `Profiles` and `Settings` directories to the new version. |
| **Archive** (ZIP Archive) | Similar to Portable, but stores settings and profiles in `~\Documents\NETworkManager`. Useful for custom deployment scenarios (e.g. Terminal Server). |

## System requirements

- Windows 10 / Server x64 (22H2 or later)
- [.NET Desktop Runtime 10.0 (LTS) - x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/10.0/runtime)

## Silent install

Install the Setup (MSI) silently using the following command:

```
.\NETworkManager_{VERSION}_Setup.msi /quiet /norestart
```

## Enterprise Deployment / Policies

NETworkManager supports system-wide policies that allow administrators to enforce specific settings for all users on a machine — for example, disabling the automatic update check at startup. Policies are defined in a `config.json` file placed in the application installation directory and can be deployed via Group Policy, Intune, SCCM, or any other configuration management tool.

See the [System-Wide Policies](/docs/system-wide-policies) documentation for details on available policy options and how to configure them.

## Code Signing Policy

NETworkManager uses free code signing services from [SignPath.io](https://signpath.io/) and a free code signing certificate provided by the [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org/) to sign all official binaries and installers, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of your downloads.

After each build, the artifacts are automatically sent to [SignPath.io](https://signpath.io/) via webhook, where they are signed following manual approval by the maintainer. Once signed, the binaries are uploaded to the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/BornToBeRoot/NETworkManager/releases).

## Privacy Policy

Your privacy matters. NETworkManager will not transfer any information to other networked systems unless specifically requested by the user or the person installing or operating it.

- [api.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement) - Check for application updates.
- [ipify.org](https://www.ipify.org/) - Retrieve the public IP address used by the client.
- [ip-api.com](https://ip-api.com/docs/legal) - Retrieve network information (e.g., geolocation, ISP, DNS resolver) used by the client.
