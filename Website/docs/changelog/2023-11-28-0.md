- Windows 10 / Server x64 (1809 or later)
- [.NET Desktop Runtime 8.0 (LTS) - x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0/runtime)

## Breaking Changes

- Migrated from .NET 6.0 (LTS) to .NET 8.0 (LTS).
  Upgrade your [.NET Desktop Runtime to version 8.0 (LTS) - x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0/runtime) before you install this version. [#2560](https://github.com/BornToBeRoot/NETworkManager/pull/2560)
