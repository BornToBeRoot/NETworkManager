# Hosts File Editor

In the **Hosts File Editor**, you can view and modify the `hosts` file of the local computer.

:::info

The hosts file is a plain text file that maps hostnames to IP addresses and is checked by the operating system before querying DNS servers. It's commonly used to override DNS settings for testing websites, redirecting domains, or blocking access to certain sites. On Windows, the file is located at `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` and requires administrator privileges to edit.

Each line in the hosts file typically contains an IP address followed by one or more hostnames, separated by spaces or tabs. Lines starting with `#` are comments and ignored by the system.

Example of a hosts file entry:

```plain
10.8.0.10 example.borntoberoot.net # Test server not reachable via DNS
```
