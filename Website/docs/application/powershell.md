# PowerShell

With **PowerShell** you can launch PowerShell consoles locally or connect to remote computers using [PowerShell Remoting](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/ps101/08-powershell-remoting). You can also execute command-line applications such as `wsl`, `k9s`, or any other tools typically accessible from a PowerShell session. In addition, you can run PowerShell scripts directly within the console.

The integration of PuTTY with NETworkManger supports tabs and profiles for hosts (and tools). You can launch the console / establish a connection via a profile (double-click, Enter key or right-click `Connect`) or directly via the [connection](#connect) dialog.

:::info

PowerShell is a command-line shell and scripting language developed by Microsoft for automating administrative tasks and managing system configurations. It provides a robust set of built-in commands and access to .NET Framework objects, allowing for efficient system administration and automation. PowerShell uses a verb-noun syntax, allowing users to perform a wide range of operations by executing simple and powerful commands.

:::

:::note

Windows PowerShell and PowerShell are supported. Indructions for installing PowerShell Core can be found on the [official website](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?).

:::

:::tip

Launching a command-line application such as `wsl` or `k9s` can be done by passing the [command](#command) to the PowerShell console.

```powershell
# Connect to WSL
wsl -d <DISTRIBUTION>

# Connect to Kubernetes
k9s --readonly
```

See [FAQ > PowerShell with command-line applications](../faq/powershell-cmd-apps) for more information.

:::warning

If Windows Terminal is installed, change the `Default terminal application` in the settings of Windows Terminal to `Windows Console Host` instead of `Windows Terminal` to use PowerShell in NETworkManager.
