# IP Geolocation

With **IP Geolocation** you can retrieve geolocation information for a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or a public IP address.

IP geolocation data is provided by [ip-api.com](https://ip-api.com/) and the API endpoint `http://ip-api.com/json/<host>` is queried when the information is requested.

:::note

The free API endpoint is limited to 45 requests per minute, supports only the `http` protocol and is available for non-commercial use only.

Example inputs:

- `borntoberoot.net`
