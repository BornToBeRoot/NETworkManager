NETworkManager 2025.10.18.0 introduces a more flexible and efficient way to manage your profiles.

Tags can now be added or removed directly within each profile, making it easier to organize and quickly find your hosts and networks.

You can filter profiles across different features using the new filter button next to the search box.

Choose between two filter modes:

- Match all – show profiles that include all selected tags (e.g., `prod` and `dns`)
- Match any – show profiles that include at least one selected tag (e.g., `prod` or `dev`)

Additionally, profile groups can now be collapsed or expanded all at once. Right-click on any group header to open the new context menu, where you can choose to expand or collapse all groups with a single action.

These updates make managing large sets of profiles faster, cleaner, and more intuitive than ever.

Upgrade now to the [latest version of NETworkManager](https://borntoberoot.net/NETworkManager/download) to use this feature.

More information is available in the [official documentation](https://borntoberoot.net/NETworkManager/docs/groups-and-profiles).
