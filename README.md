## Code Signing Policy

NETworkManager uses free code signing provided by [SignPath.io](https://signpath.io/) and a free code signing certificate
from [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org/).

The binaries and installer are built on [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/BornToBeRoot/networkmanager) directly from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/BornToBeRoot/NETworkManager/blob/main/appveyor.yml).
Build artifacts are automatically sent to [SignPath.io](https://signpath.io/) via webhook, where they are signed after manual approval by the maintainer.
The signed binaries are then uploaded to the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/BornToBeRoot/NETworkManager/releases) page.

## Privacy Policy

This program will not transfer any information to other networked systems unless specifically requested by the user or the person installing or operating it.

NETworkManager has integrated the following services for additional functions, which can be enabled or disabled at the first start (in the welcome dialog) or at any time in the settings:

- [api.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement) (Check for program updates)
- [ipify.org](https://www.ipify.org/) (Retrieve the public IP address used by the client)
- [ip-api.com](https://ip-api.com/docs/legal) (Retrieve network information such as geo location, ISP, DNS resolver used, etc. used by the client)
