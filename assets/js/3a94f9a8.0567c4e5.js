These policies override user-specific settings and provide centralized control over application behavior in enterprise environments.\\n\\nWhen a policy is active, the corresponding setting is locked in the UI and displays a shield icon along with a message indicating that the setting is managed by an administrator. Users can see the enforced value but cannot change it.\\n\\n## How to Configure Policies\\n\\nPolicies are defined in a `config.json` file placed in the application installation directory (the same folder as `NETworkManager.exe`). When this file exists, the application loads the policies at startup and applies them with precedence over user settings. An example file (`config.json.example`) is included in the application installation directory for reference.\\n\\n**File location:**\\n\\n- **Installed version**: `C:\\\\Program Files\\\\NETworkManager\\\\config.json` (or your custom installation path)\\n- **Portable version**: Same directory as `NETworkManager.exe`\\n\\n**File format:**\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\"Policy_Name\\": true\\n}\\n```\\n\\nProperty names follow the pattern `Section_SettingName`. You can find the available policy names and values in the corresponding [setting\'s documentation](https://borntoberoot.net/NETworkManager/docs/category/settings).\\n\\n### Example Policy\\n\\nFor example, the [`Update_CheckForUpdatesAtStartup`](https://borntoberoot.net/NETworkManager/docs/settings/update) policy controls whether the application checks for new program versions on GitHub when the application is launched. The [`Profiles_FolderLocation`](https://borntoberoot.net/NETworkManager/docs/settings/profiles) and [`Settings_FolderLocation`](https://borntoberoot.net/NETworkManager/docs/settings/settings) policies allow administrators to redirect profile and settings storage to a centralized location, such as a network share or a custom local path.\\n\\n**Values:**\\n\\n- `Update_CheckForUpdatesAtStartup`:\\n  - `true` \u2014 Force enable automatic update checks at startup for all users\\n  - `false` \u2014 Force disable automatic update checks at startup for all users\\n  - Omit the property \u2014 Allow users to control this setting themselves\\n- `Profiles_FolderLocation` / `Settings_FolderLocation`:\\n  - Absolute path (e.g., `C:\\\\\\\\Path\\\\\\\\To\\\\\\\\Profiles`)\\n  - Path with environment variables (e.g., `%UserProfile%\\\\\\\\NETworkManager\\\\\\\\Settings`)\\n  - UNC path (e.g., `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Server\\\\\\\\Shared\\\\\\\\NETworkManager\\\\\\\\Profiles`)\\n  - Omit the property \u2014 Allow the default location logic to apply\\n\\n**Example `config.json`:**\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\"Update_CheckForUpdatesAtStartup\\": false,\\n  \\"Profiles_FolderLocation\\": \\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Server\\\\\\\\Shared\\\\\\\\NETworkManager\\\\\\\\Profiles\\",\\n  \\"Settings_FolderLocation\\": \\"%UserProfile%\\\\\\\\NETworkManager\\\\\\\\Settings\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n:::note\\n\\n- The file must be named exactly `config.json`\\n- The file must contain valid JSON syntax\\n- Changes to the file require restarting the application to take effect\\n- If the file doesn\'t exist or contains invalid JSON, it will be ignored and user settings will apply\\n\\n:::\\n\\n## Deploying Policies\\n\\n1. **Create the configuration file** \u2014 Use the `config.json.example` as a template, rename it to `config.json`, and set your desired policy values.\\n\\n2. **Deploy to installation directory** \u2014 Place the `config.json` file in the same directory as `NETworkManager.exe`. For MSI installations, this is typically `C:\\\\Program Files\\\\NETworkManager\\\\`.\\n\\n3. **Deploy methods:**\\n   - Group Policy \u2014 copy the file to the installation directory (use Group Policy preferences or a startup script)\\n   - Configuration management tools \u2014 SCCM/ConfigMgr, Microsoft Intune, Ansible, etc.\\n   - Scripts and deployment toolkits \u2014 PowerShell scripts, PSAppDeployToolkit\\n   - Manual deployment \u2014 hand-copy for small-scale rollouts\\n\\n4. **Verification:**\\n   - Launch the application\\n   - Navigate to Settings > Update (e.g., \\"Check for updates at startup\\")\\n   - Verify the shield icon and the administrator message appear and that the control is disabled\\n\\n:::warning\\n\\nEnsure the `config.json` file has appropriate permissions so that regular users cannot modify it. On standard installations in `Program Files`, this is automatically enforced by Windows file permissions.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n## Request More Policies\\n\\nAdditional policy options will be added in future releases to provide more granular control over application behavior.
